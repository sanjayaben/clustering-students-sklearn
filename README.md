## Random student data generator
### Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.X. Uses sklearn and pickle
### Project Motivation
The biggest constraint we often come accross during machine learning is the unavailability of quality data. So as a starting point we sometimes require to create dummy datasets. The project demosntrate an example of how dummy student names can be generated with their respective attribute values.
### File Descriptions
There are couple of python files in the repo
1. gaussian_blobs_clustering.py - generates random attribute values for students
2. random_name_generator.py - code related to generating the random student names
